- [x] .no-git
- [x] .TicTacToeNNet
- [x] isort
- [x] util *
- [x] unused imports
- [x] keras types
- [ ] add type arguments for all `np.ndarray` in the project. If needed, merge the similar ones into one single type and put it in type.py.
- [x] `from alpha_zero_general.type import Any`
- [x] Fix deps
  - ImportError while importing test module '/Users/pablo/LocalDocs/repo/eye-on/suragnair/alpha-zero-general/tests/test_all_games.py'.
- [x] Do not write all dependency like we do in requirements. Instead, only control the top-level dependencies via pyproject.toml. The rest should be installed automatically.
- [x] use correct default param like
- [x] Why do we need BoardState
- [ ] type protocols and abstract classes
- [ ] project level config
  - [ ] and `from alpha_zero_general.rts.src.config_class import CONFIG`
- `array2string(board)` instead of `board.tostring()`
- better file save paths, remove `os` (security)
- [ ] enum type for `Player` and `Piece`
- [x] rm folder `chore`
- [ ] use pathlib for paths
- [ ] `import sys` and `sys.path.append("..")`
- [x] `np.array2string(board)` as hash has performance issues
- [ ] related to last get str representation
  - __str__ and __repr__ are two methods.
  - to use it as hash, use `__hash__` is better
- [ ] format off for data list, like in `test_symmetries_n3`
- [ ] style/type-gymnastics
- [ ] retire `alpha_zero_general.type`
- [ ] rename `./alpha_zero_general/neural_net.py` to `neural_net_interface.py`
